- **`code-formatter.json`** - Automated code formatting and style correction
- **`dependency-manager.json`** - Manages project dependencies and requirements
- **`task-completion-detector.json`** - Detects and tracks task completion status
- **`force-activate-all.json`** - Activates all available hooks for comprehensive analysis
- **`automated-testing.json`** - Automated test execution and validation
- **`performance-analyzer.json`** - Performance profiling and optimization analysis
- **`security-audit.json`** - Security vulnerability scanning and assessment

## Usage Guidelines

### Running Development Hooks
1. Open a C source file in Kiro IDE
2. Make your code changes
3. Run the `-hooks` command to trigger comprehensive analysis
4. Review the analysis results including:
   - Code quality assessment and suggestions
   - Workflow performance metrics
   - Optimization recommendations
   - Error detection and resolution guidance
5. Apply recommended improvements and optimizations

### Best Practices
- Run comprehensive hook analysis before committing code changes
- Address all critical issues identified by the quality checks
- Monitor workflow performance metrics to optimize development efficiency
- Use adaptive learning suggestions to improve development patterns
- Keep documentation updated using the sync hook
- Review workflow status reports to identify optimization opportunities

## Integration with Learning System

## Hook Development

### Adding New Hooks
1. Create hook configuration file in `.kiro/hooks/`
2. Define trigger conditions and actions
3. Test hook functionality
4. Update this documentation
5. Add to quality assurance testing

### Hook Configuration Format
```json
{
  "enabled": boolean,
  "name": "Hook Name",
  "description": "Hook description",
  "version": "version_number",
  "when": {
    "type": "trigger_type",
    "condition": "trigger_condition"
  },
  "then": {
    "type": "action_type",
    "action": "action_configuration"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Hook Not Triggering**: Check that `enabled` is set to `true`
