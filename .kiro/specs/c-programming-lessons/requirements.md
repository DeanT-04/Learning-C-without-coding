# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a structured C programming learning system organized into progressive difficulty levels (basics, intermediate, pro, master) with hands-on lessons in each category. Each lesson includes complete C code examples, comprehensive documentation, and follows C programming best practices to teach concepts through practical implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a C programming learner, I want organized lesson folders by difficulty level, so that I can progress systematically from basics to mastery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create four main directories: basics, intermediate, pro, and master
2. WHEN each difficulty level is created THEN the system SHALL contain multiple lesson subdirectories with descriptive names
3. WHEN lesson directories are created THEN each SHALL follow a consistent naming convention (lesson-01-topic-name format)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a C programming learner, I want complete C code examples in each lesson, so that I can see working implementations of concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lesson is created THEN the system SHALL include at least one main.c file with compilable code
2. WHEN C code is written THEN the system SHALL follow C programming best practices and coding standards
3. WHEN code examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate the specific concept being taught
4. WHEN multiple files are needed THEN the system SHALL include proper header files and modular code organization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a C programming learner, I want comprehensive documentation for each lesson, so that I can understand the code and concepts being demonstrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lesson is created THEN the system SHALL include a README.md file with detailed explanations
2. WHEN documentation is written THEN it SHALL use concise, brief, and clear sentences
3. WHEN code snippets are explained THEN the documentation SHALL describe syntax, purpose, and best practices
4. WHEN concepts are introduced THEN the documentation SHALL explain how they work and why they're important

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a C programming learner, I want properly structured build systems for each lesson, so that I can compile and run the code easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lesson is created THEN the system SHALL include a Makefile for compilation
2. WHEN build files are created THEN they SHALL follow C compilation best practices
3. WHEN compilation is performed THEN the system SHALL produce error-free executables
4. WHEN build systems are tested THEN they SHALL work correctly on Windows with appropriate C compiler

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a C programming learner, I want progressive difficulty in lessons, so that I can build knowledge systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN basics lessons are created THEN they SHALL cover fundamental concepts like variables, data types, and basic I/O
2. WHEN intermediate lessons are created THEN they SHALL cover pointers, arrays, functions, and memory management
3. WHEN pro lessons are created THEN they SHALL cover advanced topics like data structures, file handling, and system programming
4. WHEN master lessons are created THEN they SHALL cover expert topics like optimization, advanced algorithms, and low-level programming

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a C programming learner, I want tested and verified code examples, so that I can trust the implementations are correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL compile without errors or warnings
2. WHEN lessons are completed THEN all code SHALL be tested for correct functionality
3. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate expected output and behavior
4. WHEN best practices are claimed THEN the code SHALL actually follow industry-standard C programming conventions
