# Design Document

## Overview

The C Programming Lessons system is designed as a progressive learning platform that teaches C programming through hands-on examples organized by difficulty levels. The system follows a structured approach where each lesson builds upon previous concepts, ensuring comprehensive understanding from basic syntax to advanced programming techniques.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

└── master/
    ├── lesson-01-advanced-algorithms/
    ├── lesson-02-system-programming/
    ├── lesson-03-optimization/
    └── ...
```

### Lesson Structure
Each lesson directory contains:
- `main.c` - Primary source code file
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `Makefile` - Build configuration
- Additional `.c` and `.h` files as needed for complex examples

## Components and Interfaces

### Lesson Component
Each lesson is a self-contained learning unit with:
- **Source Code**: Complete, compilable C programs demonstrating specific concepts
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of code, syntax, and best practices
- **Build System**: Makefile for easy compilation and execution
- **Examples**: Input/output examples showing expected behavior

### Documentation Interface
Documentation follows a consistent format:
- **Concept Overview**: Brief introduction to the topic
- **Code Explanation**: Line-by-line or block-by-block code analysis
- **Key Concepts**: Highlighted important points and best practices
- **Common Pitfalls**: Warnings about typical mistakes
- **Next Steps**: Connection to subsequent lessons

### Build Interface
Standardized Makefile structure:
- `make` - Compile the program
- `make run` - Compile and execute
- `make clean` - Remove compiled files
- `make debug` - Compile with debugging symbols

## Data Models

```

### Code Quality Standards
- **Naming Conventions**: snake_case for variables and functions, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces, no tabs
- **Comments**: Meaningful comments explaining complex logic
- **Error Handling**: Proper return codes and error checking
- **Memory Management**: Explicit allocation/deallocation with checks

## Error Handling

### Compilation Errors
- All code must compile without errors using standard C compiler flags
- Warning-free compilation with `-Wall -Wextra` flags
- Proper handling of compiler-specific features

### Runtime Error Prevention
- Input validation in interactive programs
- Bounds checking for array access
- Null pointer checks before dereferencing
- Memory leak prevention through proper cleanup

### Educational Error Examples
- Deliberate examples showing common mistakes and their fixes
- Before/after code comparisons
- Explanation of error messages and debugging techniques

## Testing Strategy

### Compilation Testing
- Automated compilation checks for all lessons
- Cross-platform compatibility verification (Windows focus)
- Multiple compiler support (GCC, Clang, MSVC)

### Functionality Testing
- Expected output verification for each program
- Input/output testing for interactive programs
- Edge case testing for algorithms and data structures

### Educational Effectiveness Testing
- Progressive difficulty validation
- Concept dependency verification
- Code clarity and documentation quality review

### Build System Testing
- Makefile functionality across different environments
- Clean build verification
- Debug build testing

## Implementation Considerations

### Windows Platform Specifics
- Use of Windows-compatible C compiler (MinGW, MSVC, or Clang)
- Path separators and file handling considerations
- Console I/O compatibility

### Best Practices Integration
- Industry-standard coding conventions
- Modern C standards (C11/C18/C23 features where appropriate)
- Security-conscious programming practices
- Performance optimization techniques

### Progressive Learning Design
- Each lesson builds on previous concepts
- Clear prerequisites and learning objectives
- Practical examples that solve real problems
- Incremental complexity increase

### Documentation Standards
- Consistent formatting and structure
- Code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Visual diagrams for complex concepts (using ASCII art or Mermaid)
- Cross-references between related lessons
