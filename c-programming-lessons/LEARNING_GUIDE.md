## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setup Your Environment
- Ensure you have a C compiler installed (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Clone or download this repository
- Navigate to the `c-programming-lessons` directory

### 2. Test Your Setup
Run the comprehensive test suite to verify everything works:
```bash
# Run all tests
run_comprehensive_tests.bat

# Or run individual test components
test_all_lessons.bat              # Compilation tests
python validate_code_quality.py  # Code quality checks
validate_lesson_structure.bat     # Structure validation
```

### 3. Start Learning
Begin with the basics level:
```bash
cd basics/lesson-01-hello-world
make
make run
```

### 4. Follow the Learning Path
